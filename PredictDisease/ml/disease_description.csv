Squamous cell carcinoma,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the ear, eyelid or nose is a skin cancer caused by repeated exposure to the sun. White, or light colored, cats are more susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma."
Lymphosarcoma,Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is linked to most forms of LSA except for the gastrointestinal (GI) form. FeLV is a transmittable retrovirus that can be passed in utero as well as through saliva and direct contact.
Diabetes,"Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose”which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat."
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus,"Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow-acting, a cats immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold. This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections."
Feline Leukemia Virus,feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely inhibit a cats immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesnt always manifest symptoms right away
Heartworm,"Spread by infected mosquitoes, heartworm is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health problems in domestic cats. Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily causes lung disease in cats. It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian."
Rabies,"Rabies is a viral disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of all mammals, including cats, dogs and humans. This preventable disease has been reported in every state except Hawaii. Theres good reason that the very word œrabies evokes fear in people”once symptoms appear, rabies is close to 100% fatal."
Ringworm,"Although the name suggests otherwise, ringworm isnt caused by a worm at all”but a fungus that can infect the skin, hair and nails. Not uncommon in cats, this highly contagious disease can lead to patchy, circular areas of hair loss with central red rings. Also known as dermatophytosis, ringworm often spreads to other pets in the household”and to humans, too."
Upper Respiratory Infections,"A cats upper respiratory tract”the nose, throat and sinus area”is susceptible to infections caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria."
Worms,"Cats can acquire a variety of intestinal parasites, including some that are commonly referred to as œworms. Infestations of intestinal worms can cause a variety of symptoms. Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well."
kidney disease,"Kidneys filter out waste and regulate blood and water levels. If there is a breakdown or deterioration in the kidneys, cats can develop acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease. Acute renal failure typically develops quickly and can be reversed if its diagnosed in time. Chronic kidney disease cannot be cured, but early diagnosis and proper care can ensure that the feline lives a high-quality life."
Gingivitis,"This is a condition that causes painful inflammation of the gums, usually as a result of plaque buildup."
Periodontitis,Gingivitis that is left untreated can result in periodontitis. This occurs when there is damage to the soft tissue of the gums or the bone that supports the teeth.
Tooth Resorption,This occurs when the inside structure of a tooth breaks down. Tooth resorption has unknown causes and is the most common reason for tooth loss in cats.
obesity,"Generally, a cat weighing 20% more than their ideal weight is considered obese. Feline obesity shortens a cats lifespan and makes them more susceptible to diseases and health conditions"
Pancreatitis,"For cats and humans alike, the pancreas performs vital functions in the digestive process. Pancreatitis develops when the pancreas becomes inflamed, and in cats it is also usually accompanied by inflammation in the liver and intestines. The cause of pancreatitis in cats is unknown, but some felines with diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease may be at a higher risk."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is an endocrine disease that affects middle-aged and older cats. It is most commonly caused by benign growths on the thyroid gland that increase its size and function, leading to an increase in the concentration of thyroid gland hormones."
